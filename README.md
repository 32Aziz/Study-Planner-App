# 📚 Study Planner

A full-featured **Study Planner web application** built using **Python, Streamlit, and SQLite**.

The app helps students manage study tasks, track deadlines, visualize workload, and receive intelligent study suggestions using AI.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a **realistic and useful Streamlit application** that demonstrates:

- Strong Python fundamentals
- Clean code structure
- Database integration
- Data visualization
- Thoughtful use of AI

---

## 🚀 Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Dashboard** | Overview of total, completed, pending, and overdue tasks |
| **Add Task** | Form with validation to create new study tasks |
| **Manage Tasks** | Search, filter, sort, update, and delete tasks |
| **Analytics (Data Science Bonus)** | Interactive charts showing workload and trends |
| **AI Suggestions (AI Bonus)** | Personalized study plan using Gemini or rule-based logic |
| **Database** | SQLite database with automatic setup |
| **Export/Backup** | Export your study data to CSV for external analysis |
| **Performance** | Optimized with `st.cache_data` for lightning-fast metrics |

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2. (Optional) Setup AI

Create `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

> If no key is provided, the app will use a rule-based system instead.

### 3. (Optional) Add demo data

```bash
python -m src.seed_data
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 AI Feature (Bonus)

The app includes an **AI-powered study suggestion system**:

* Uses **Gemini API** if a key is provided
* Falls back to a **rule-based system** if not

The AI analyzes:

* Task priority
* Deadlines
* Estimated hours
* Subject distribution

Then generates:

* Study plan
* Task prioritization
* Time management advice

---

## 📊 Data Science Feature (Bonus)

The Analytics page includes:

* Tasks by subject (pie chart)
* Tasks by status (bar chart)
* Study hours per subject
* Workload over time (area chart)

This helps users understand their study patterns and workload distribution.

---

## 🗃️ Database

SQLite is used for simplicity and portability.

* No external setup required
* Automatically created on first run

Main table:

```sql
tasks(
  id, title, subject, description,
  due_date, priority, status,
  estimated_hours, created_at
)
```

---

## 🧩 Design Decisions

* **Streamlit** → fast development, easy UI, ideal for demos
* **SQLite** → lightweight, no server needed
* **Modular structure** → separates UI, logic, and data
* **Rule-based fallback AI** → ensures app works without API
* **Caching (`st.cache_data`)** → optimizes database reads for faster page loads

---

## 🤖 AI Usage

AI tools were used to:

* Assist with project structure design
* Generate initial code scaffolding
* Improve UI and code readability
* Debug and refine features

All generated code was reviewed, tested, and understood before final use.
